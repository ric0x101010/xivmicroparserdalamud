# xivmicropaser
XIV Micro Parser Plugin for Dalamud.
There is also an alternative version as ACT Overlay: https://github.com/ric0x101010/xivmicroparser 

It serves as a simplified presentation of the most important information about the fight.
Broken down to:
- The actual Fight Time.
- The Time to Kill (TTK). **Is calculated on the basis of the current rDPS and can be different, but is only intended as a guideline.** 
- Kill Time (KT), calculated on Time in Fight and Time to Kill
- Progress Bar
- The group rDPS.

### Test Feature
- Checkbox for 50% TTK, this is there to get the time to kill for the 50% limit in fights like P8S P1. The percentage is also calculated with half of the HP so that 0% is displayed at 50% HP.
